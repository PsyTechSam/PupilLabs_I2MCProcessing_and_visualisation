# PupilLabs_I2MCProcessing_and_visualisation
Python/Matlab combined implementation of I2MC algorithim from Roy Hessels: https://github.com/royhessels/I2MC

Python code for extraction of Pupil labs recorder data (v0.6??) that utilises the matlab engine to run the I2MC algorithim on the data before visualising outputs.

More will be added here later.
